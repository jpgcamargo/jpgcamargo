## 🚀 What I’m Working On
**Probabilistic ML for Vision Inspection** — my research project at Virginia Tech’s SEAD Lab  
- Modeling **aleatoric** (random noise) and **epistemic** (setup bias) uncertainty in automated inspection  
- Building **synthetic datasets** in Python (NumPy, Pandas)  
- Applying **ML** (logistic regression, ensembles, Bayesian) to estimate **P(in spec)**  
- Optimizing **accept / reject / re-inspect** policies to minimize expected cost (false reject/false accept)

## 💼 Experience Highlights
**The L.S. Starrett Company — Manufacturing/Process Engineering Intern**  
- Replaced chemical etching with a **femtosecond laser** → eliminated hazardous waste and projected **$1M+ annual savings**  
- Built SOPs and led cross-functional training for **automated vision inspection**; supported CNC verification to ±0.0002"  
- Analyzed outsourcing opportunities with **Oracle + Noetix**, reducing labor, rework, and scrap  

**SEAD Lab (Virginia Tech) — Undergraduate Researcher**  
- Probabilistic ML for **measurement uncertainty** and **cost-aware decision-making** in automated inspection

---

## 📈 Current Focus
- Turning inspection measurements into **probabilities + costs**  
- Comparing **classical quality tools** vs **probabilistic ML**  
- Reproducible pipelines: data → uncertainty → decision → **expected cost**
